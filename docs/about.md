# About This Project

The Sexagesimal Calculator was originally developed as a summer project for the [**History of Mathematics in India (HoMI)**](https://sites.iitgn.ac.in/homi/) initiative at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/).

It has since been completely refactored into a modern, robust, and professionally maintained open-source Python library.

### Quality and Testing

This project is committed to a high standard of code quality and correctness.

-   **Test Coverage:** The library maintains a high level of test coverage, verified on every commit via continuous integration.
-   **Property-Based Testing:** In addition to standard unit tests, the library is rigorously validated using [`hypothesis`](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a powerful property-based testing framework. This ensures that the arithmetic logic is correct for a vast range of inputs, including edge cases that are difficult to find with manual testing.
